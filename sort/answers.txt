sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: The data take the longest amount of time to sort in the worst case scenario, but it is the fastest when sorted because it only has to run once

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: It takes the least amount of time between the three methods and the time to sort is relatively similar whether or not the data is sorted, random or reversed.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: It takes longer to sort than the merge sort, and the time for sorting dosen't vary much whether or not the data is sorted, random or reversed.
